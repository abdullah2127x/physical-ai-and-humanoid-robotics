## Design Principles Applied

### 1. Concept Density Analysis
Each chapter's lesson count justified by:
- Core concept count extracted from spec
- B1 proficiency tier capacity (5-7 concepts max per lesson at entry point)
- Cognitive load limits respected throughout

### 2. Four-Layer Teaching Framework
All chapters progress through stages:
1. **Layer 1 (Manual):** Foundation without AI (Lessons 1-2)
2. **Layer 2 (AI Collaboration):** Same tasks with AI guidance + Three Roles (Lessons 3-5)
3. **Layer 3 (Intelligence Design):** Create reusable components (Lesson 6)
4. **Layer 4 (Spec-Driven):** Integration capstone using all layers (Lesson 7-8)

### 3. Three Roles Integration (Layer 2)
Every Layer 2 lesson demonstrates:
- **AI as Teacher:** Introduces pattern student didn't know
- **AI as Student:** Adapts and learns from student feedback
- **AI as Co-Worker:** Iterate toward better solution together

Example (Chapter 1, Lesson 3):
- AI teaches ROS 2 CLI debugging approach
- Student refines tool usage
- Together converge on systematic debugging checklist

### 4. Show-Then-Explain Pedagogy
Every lesson opens with:
1. Working example executed (immediate gratification)
2. Challenge question posed
3. Concepts explained through walkthrough
4. Students practice with exercises
5. Success validated with clear criteria

### 5. Heavy Scaffolding for B1
All B1-tier chapters include:
- Step-by-step walkthroughs (no assumptions)
- Code templates with gaps to fill
- Frequent checkpoints to verify understanding
- Multiple practice exercises per concept
- Clear debugging guides for common errors

### 6. Evals-First Validation
Every lesson:
- Maps to at least one specification success criterion
- Includes measurable success criteria (checkboxes)
- Formative assessment during lesson
- Summative capstone assessment end of chapter

## Architectural Decisions

### Decision 1: Lesson Sequence Order (Chapters 1-2)

**Rationale:** Layer-based progression mandatory
- Layer 1 (manual): Lessons 1-2 establish foundation without AI
- Layer 2 (AI collab): Lessons 3-5 extend same concepts with AI guidance
- Layer 3 (intelligence): Lesson 6 encapsulates patterns
- Layer 4 (spec-driven): Lesson 7 integrates all

**Why:** Skipping layers (e.g., spec-first in Lesson 1) violates pedagogical progression and causes cognitive overload.

### Decision 2: Lesson Count (Not Arbitrary 9)

**Rationale:** Driven by concept density analysis
- Chapter 1: 6 concepts → 7 lessons (2+3+1+1 per layer)
- Chapter 2: 6 concepts → 7 lessons (2+3+1+1 per layer)
- Chapter 3: 7 concepts → 8 lessons (2+3+2+1 per layer, extra for 3D complexity)

**Why:** Arbitrary 9-lesson template ignores concept complexity and proficiency limits. Concept density analysis ensures right-sized lessons.

### Decision 3: Three Roles in Layer 2 (Not Optional)

**Rationale:** Constitution requires bidirectional AI learning
- One-way instruction (AI just executes) = passive tool learning
- Three Roles = bidirectional learning (student and AI both improve)

**Why:** Students learn both subject matter AND how to collaborate with AI as thinking partner.

### Decision 4: Heavy Scaffolding (Not "Self-Directed")

**Rationale:** B1 proficiency tier requires heavy guidance
- Advanced learners (C1-C2): Light scaffolding acceptable
- B1 beginners: Heavy step-by-step guidance necessary

**Why:** B1 learners lack context to "figure it out"; heavy scaffolding builds confidence and correctness.

### Decision 5: Spec-Driven Only in Layer 4

**Rationale:** Specification writing is advanced skill
- Layers 1-3: Manual foundation and pattern building
- Layer 4 only: Compose learned patterns using spec

**Why:** Teaching spec-first in Layer 1 skips manual foundation and causes downstream confusion. Layer 4 capstones integrate all learning.

## Pedagogical Innovation

### Innovation 1: Reusable Patterns (Layer 3)

Each chapter's Lesson 6 creates reusable components from Lessons 1-5:
- **Chapter 1:** Generic publisher/subscriber templates
- **Chapter 2:** Generic action client template + async node base class
- **Chapter 3:** URDF macros (xacro) for links and joints

**Benefit:** Students see how patterns scale and abstract. Prepares for Part 2 where these patterns reused.

### Innovation 2: AI Collaboration Depth

Layer 2 doesn't just show AI code generation. Instead:
- AI teaches concepts students don't know
- Students provide feedback that improves AI suggestions
- Both converge on better solution than either alone

**Benefit:** Students learn AI isn't just tool but thinking partner with strengths and weaknesses.

### Innovation 3: Specification-Driven Capstone

Layer 4 capstone isn't "project"; it's practicing specification-driven development:
1. **Specification first** (intent, constraints, success criteria)
2. **Design before code** (architecture, component roles)
3. **Implement to spec** (code that satisfies requirements)
4. **Validate against spec** (test each criterion)

**Benefit:** Prepares students for professional development practices. Sets expectation: spec drives code, not vice versa.
