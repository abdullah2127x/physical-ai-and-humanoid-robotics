## I. Chapter Analysis

### Chapter Type
**Technical/Hands-On with 3D Modeling** — Teaches robot physical modeling using URDF XML. Learning objectives emphasize "Apply" and "Create" levels: writing URDF, defining geometric properties, building articulated models, visualizing in RViz.

### Concept Density Analysis

**Core Concepts** (from spec): 7 core concepts
1. Link (rigid body/segment in robot)
2. Joint (connection between links with constraints)
3. Visual Geometry (how robot looks in simulation)
4. Collision Geometry (simplified shape for physics/collisions)
5. Inertial Properties (mass, center of mass, inertia tensor)
6. Joint Types (revolute, prismatic, fixed, continuous)
7. TF/Transform (coordinate frame relationships)

**Complexity Assessment:** Standard-Moderate complexity
- Concepts are concrete (physical structure) but interconnected
- 3D thinking required (new for beginners)
- XML syntax must be precise (errors common)
- Cognitive load appropriate for B1 with heavy scaffolding

**Proficiency Tier:** B1 (Intermediate Foundation)
- From chapter-index.md: Chapter 03 tier is B1
- Concept cap for B1: 5-7 concepts
- 7 concepts at maximum capacity
- Scaffolding for B1: Heavy guidance, step-by-step walkthrough

**Justified Lesson Count:** 8 lessons
- **Layer 1 (Manual):** 2 lessons — Single link and joint fundamentals without AI
- **Layer 2 (AI Collaboration):** 3 lessons — Inertial properties, joint configuration with AI
- **Layer 3 (Intelligence Design):** 2 lessons — Reusable link/joint templates
- **Layer 4 (Spec-Driven):** 1 lesson — Build complete humanoid upper body from specification

**Total:** 8 lessons (justified by 7 concepts at B1 capacity + 3D complexity + heavy scaffolding)

### Rationale for Lesson Count
- Chapter 3 builds on Chapters 1-2 (nodes, pub/sub, Python packages)
- 7 core concepts at B1 maximum capacity
- 3D modeling adds cognitive load (justifies extra lesson)
- Progressive complexity: single link → joint → inertial properties → articulated systems
- Multiple exercises per concept (heavy scaffolding required)
- NOT arbitrary; sized specifically for geometric modeling pedagogy

## II. Success Evals (from Spec)

**Predefined Success Criteria** — Chapter 3 students must demonstrate:

1. **Eval-3.1:** Students write valid URDF XML syntax → Maps to LO-3.1 (Apply)
2. **Eval-3.2:** Students define links with visual, collision, inertial properties → Maps to LO-3.2 (Apply)
3. **Eval-3.3:** Students create joints (revolute, prismatic, fixed) with limits → Maps to LO-3.3 (Apply)
4. **Eval-3.4:** Students calculate inertial properties for basic shapes → Maps to LO-3.4 (Apply)
5. **Eval-3.5:** Students visualize URDF in RViz and manipulate model → Maps to LO-3.5 (Apply)
6. **Eval-3.6:** Students build complete humanoid upper body → Maps to LO-3.6 (Create)

**All lessons below map to at least one evaluation criterion.**

## III. Lesson Sequence

### Lesson 1: URDF Fundamentals and Single Link (Layer 1: Manual)

**Learning Objective:** Understand URDF XML syntax and create a single rigid body with visual properties.

**CEFR Proficiency:** B1

**New Concepts** (count: 3 ≤ 7 limit): ✅ WITHIN LIMIT
1. Link (rigid body, defined in URDF)
2. Visual Geometry (how link appears in visualization)
3. URDF XML structure (robot element, attributes, nesting)

**Cognitive Load Validation:** 3 concepts ≤ 7 limit → ✅ WITHIN LIMIT

**Maps to Evals:** Eval-3.1 (valid URDF), Eval-3.2 (link definition)

**Content Elements**

**Opening Narrative (Show-Then-Explain):**
- Show: Simple URDF with one link (box geometry)
- Show: Loaded in RViz, displayed as 3D box
- Challenge: "What parts of this XML create the box?"

- Structure: `<robot>` root, contains `<link>` and `<joint>` elements
- Single link example: Just one `<link>` with visual geometry
- Geometry types: Box (dimensions), Cylinder (radius, length), Sphere (radius), Mesh (file)

**Manual Link Creation Walkthrough:**

1. Collision Geometry (simplified shape for physics, different from visual)
2. Inertial Properties (mass, center of mass, inertia tensor)

**Cognitive Load Validation:** 2 new + 3 from L1 = 5 ≤ 7 limit → ✅ WITHIN LIMIT

**Maps to Evals:** Eval-3.2 (link properties), Eval-3.4 (inertial calculation)

**Content Elements**

**Opening Narrative:**

2. Joint Types (revolute, prismatic, fixed, continuous)

**Cognitive Load Validation:** 2 new + 5 previous ≤ 7 → ✅ WITHIN LIMIT

**Three Roles Demonstrations** (REQUIRED)

**1. AI as Teacher:**
- **Scenario:** Student asks "How do I make links move relative to each other?"
- **AI Response:**
  ```
  "Great question! Joints define how links move together.
  There are 4 main joint types:

  1. Revolute: Rotates around axis (like shoulder joint)
  2. Prismatic: Slides along axis (like piston)
  3. Fixed: No movement (like weld)
  4. Continuous: Infinite rotation (like wheel)

  Each joint specifies:
  - Parent link (where it starts)
  - Child link (where it ends)
  - Axis of movement
  - Limits (min/max angle or position)"
  ```

**2. AI as Student:**
- **Scenario:** Student creates revolute joint with very large limits (±1000 radians)

- **Convergence:** Physically realistic joint

**Content Elements:**

**Opening Narrative:**

**Joint Concepts:**
- Joint as bridge between two links
- Parent frame: Where joint originates
- Child frame: Relative position of child link
- Axis: Direction of rotation/sliding
- Limits: Min/max movement

**Joint Types Detailed:**
- Revolute: θ_min ≤ θ ≤ θ_max (most common in robots)
- Prismatic: d_min ≤ d ≤ d_max (linear motion)
- Fixed: No movement (structural connection)
- Continuous: 0 ≤ θ < ∞ (wheels, continuous rotation)

**Manual Implementation (with AI guidance):**
