# Chatbot Generator Prompts

## For Docusaurus Applications

Please use the chatbot-generator skill to create a complete chatbot component for my Docusaurus application.

I need you to:
1. Generate a chatbot component that integrates with my Docusaurus site
2. Make sure it respects my existing project's theme variables and styling
3. Include all the functionality from the reference implementation (session management, text selection, history persistence, etc.)
4. Create the complete set of documentation (spec, plan, tasks) along with the implementation
5. Follow Docusaurus-specific integration patterns and best practices
6. Automatically integrate the chatbot into my Docusaurus application root so it appears throughout the entire site

The generated component should be placed in a clean folder structure and automatically integrated into my Docusaurus layout. Please analyze my project's existing CSS custom properties and use them in the chatbot's styling to maintain visual consistency.

## For React/Next.js Applications

Please use the chatbot-generator skill to create a complete chatbot component for my React/Next.js application.

I need you to:
